                    <p> Hi there, My name is Ven Gallardo and I specialized in website development and design. Before I was just a grab driver and a driver for a rental services here in Manila. But when the pandemic strikes, I decided to shift my career into web development. This is to pursue my dream on programming and designs. I first stumbled on no code platforms like bubble.io and glide.io. And then after learning some basic knowledge on how websites work. I then started to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React JS. Now this website is running only with code using google cloud as server.</p>
